# MistNet Web
Developing web libraries for interoperability

This program is an automatic conversion of "https://github.com/DecentralizedMetaverse/mistnet/tree/master/Assets/MistNet/Runtime" into TypeScript, and it is not currently in a usable state. It is planned to be improved in the future and made applicable for metaverses on the web.
